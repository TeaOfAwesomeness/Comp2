#Description
This project was created to showcase a Kohonen map.
There is a GUI to allow for a variable size in number of neurons and specify new training or testing data.

#Dependencies
There is included a resources file, which contains auto-generated descriptions of required libraries.
However, just in case it doesn't work all imported libraries are listed below:
numpy, random, math, tkinter, csv, copy

#Instructions
First, enter a real integer for the number of input and output nodes, then press the 'generate' button.
Second, enter the path to your training data.
    The path should include the file name exactly as it appears.
    The file should be a text file written in csv format using commas between variables and lines between each set.
    Each set should have the first variable be the name of the set with no spaces, followed by real numbers for inputs.
    Note: if the program struggles to accept the file path, use the 'training_data' file with that exact string as input.
    Press the in line button.
Third: the network has now been trained. Enter the file path to your test data in the 'test' textbox.
    The same rules apply as above, but only one line of data should be present.
    Press the in line button.
Fourth: The GUI should now show an array of buttons demonstrating output nodes.
    BMUs will have the name of the dataset/s they match to in their text field.
To reset, you can re-train with new data for the same size of network or re-generate and re-train for a new size.

#State
Currently, the map has been written, but the 'network' is buggy with array appending and doesn't work as intended.

#Notes
The system has some basic validation written in - such as checking a value exists - but WILL break under any amount of
stress testing.
I had hoped to get a colour-classification scheme going but being still pretty new to advanced python just debugging the
arrays took most of my time.

#References
All the work here is my own. I use equations 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 described in the following example because they seemed
sensible and I assume are standard for SOMs:

Note none of the code is used, just the equations.
